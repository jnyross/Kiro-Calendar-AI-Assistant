# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a personal AI-driven Google Calendar assistant that helps users manage their calendar events, schedule meetings, and optimize their time through intelligent automation and natural language interactions. The assistant will integrate with Google Calendar API to provide seamless calendar management capabilities while offering smart suggestions and automated scheduling features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a busy professional, I want to interact with my calendar using natural language commands, so that I can quickly schedule, modify, and query my calendar without navigating through complex interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a natural language command like "Schedule a meeting with John tomorrow at 2 PM" THEN the system SHALL use OpenRouter AI to parse the command and create the appropriate calendar event
2. WHEN a user asks "What's on my calendar today?" THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display all events for the current day in a readable format
3. WHEN a user requests to "Move my 3 PM meeting to 4 PM" THEN the system SHALL use OpenRouter AI to identify the correct event and update its time
4. IF the natural language command is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL use OpenRouter AI to generate clarifying questions before proceeding

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the assistant to provide intelligent scheduling suggestions based on my calendar patterns and preferences, so that I can make better decisions about when to schedule events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests to schedule a recurring meeting THEN the system SHALL analyze historical patterns and suggest optimal times
2. WHEN scheduling a new event THEN the system SHALL consider factors like travel time, meeting preparation time, and personal preferences
3. WHEN the user has back-to-back meetings THEN the system SHALL suggest buffer time between appointments
4. IF the system detects unusual scheduling patterns THEN the system SHALL provide insights and recommendations for better time management

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the assistant to integrate securely with my Google Calendar, so that all my calendar data remains synchronized and protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first sets up the assistant THEN the system SHALL guide them through secure OAuth authentication with Google Calendar
2. WHEN any calendar changes are made through the assistant THEN the system SHALL immediately sync with Google Calendar
3. WHEN accessing calendar data THEN the system SHALL use secure API calls with proper authentication tokens
4. IF authentication tokens expire THEN the system SHALL handle token refresh automatically without user intervention

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the assistant to help me find optimal meeting times when coordinating with others, so that I can efficiently schedule group meetings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scheduling a meeting with multiple participants THEN the system SHALL analyze everyone's availability and suggest optimal times
2. WHEN participants have conflicting schedules THEN the system SHALL rank time slots by the number of available participants
3. WHEN sending meeting invitations THEN the system SHALL include relevant details and allow for easy acceptance/decline
4. IF no common availability exists THEN the system SHALL suggest the best compromise times and identify who would need to reschedule

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a parent managing both personal and family calendars, I want to categorize events by attendance priority, so that I can distinguish between events I must attend versus placeholder events for family activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating or editing an event THEN the system SHALL allow users to set attendance priority levels: "Must Attend", "Should Attend", "Could Attend", or "Won't Attend"
2. WHEN detecting scheduling conflicts THEN the system SHALL consider attendance priorities and only flag true conflicts between "Must Attend" or "Should Attend" events
3. WHEN a user schedules a new "Must Attend" event that overlaps with a "Could Attend" or "Won't Attend" event THEN the system SHALL allow the scheduling without conflict warnings
4. WHEN displaying calendar views THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish events by attendance priority using colors or indicators
5. IF a user attempts to schedule overlapping "Must Attend" events THEN the system SHALL treat this as a true conflict and require resolution

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to store and manage contact information for key people, so that I can easily invite them to events using natural language without manually entering their details each time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the assistant THEN the system SHALL allow users to add contacts with names, email addresses, and optional additional information
2. WHEN creating an event with natural language like "Schedule lunch with Jessica tomorrow" THEN the system SHALL automatically identify Jessica from stored contacts and include her email
3. WHEN a user references a contact name that doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL prompt to add the contact information or ask for clarification
4. WHEN managing contacts THEN the system SHALL allow users to add, edit, and remove contact information through simple commands
5. IF multiple contacts have similar names THEN the system SHALL ask for clarification before proceeding with event creation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer planning for future expansion, I want the calendar assistant to be built as a modular component with well-defined interfaces, so that it can be integrated into a larger AI assistant system over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the system architecture THEN the system SHALL use modular design patterns that allow for easy integration with other AI assistant modules
2. WHEN implementing core functionality THEN the system SHALL expose clear APIs and interfaces that other modules can interact with
3. WHEN handling user interactions THEN the system SHALL use standardized communication patterns that can be shared across multiple assistant modules
4. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use data structures and storage patterns that can be extended for other assistant capabilities
5. IF future modules need to access calendar data or functionality THEN the system SHALL provide secure, well-documented interfaces for integration

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize the assistant's behavior and preferences, so that it works according to my specific needs and working style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the assistant THEN the system SHALL allow users to configure their working hours, time zones, and meeting preferences
2. WHEN the user wants to change notification settings THEN the system SHALL provide granular control over reminder types and timing
3. WHEN the user has specific scheduling rules THEN the system SHALL allow custom constraints like "no meetings before 9 AM" or "block Fridays for deep work"
4. IF the user's preferences conflict with a scheduling request THEN the system SHALL respect the preferences and suggest alternatives
